#
# This action could publish to the IBCDFO PyPI account the source distribution
# and universal wheel that it produces.  For more information on potential
# security issues associated with automatic publishing, please refer to
#
#        https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/security-model/
#
# In particular, there exists the possibility of breaking that page or allowing
# nefarious actors to alter it.  Since IBCDFO will likely be released only a few
# times a year, we presently prefer the conservative route of manually
# publishing to PyPI the distributions built and tested by this action.
#
# ALL CHANGES TO THIS ACTION SHOULD BE REVIEWED VERY CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT
#             THE CHANGES ARE AS INTENDED AND WELL UNDERSTOOD!
