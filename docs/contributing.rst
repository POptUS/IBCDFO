Contributing
============

Contributions of source code, documentation, and fixes are happily accepted
via GitHub pull request to

    https://github.com/poptus/IBCDFO/tree/develop

If you are planning a contribution, reporting bugs, or suggesting features, we
encourage you to discuss the concept by opening a GitHub issue at

  https://github.com/poptus/IBCDFO/issues

or by emailing  ``poptus@mcs.anl.gov`` and interacting with us to ensure that
your effort is well-directed.

Contribution Process
--------------------

Contributors should typically branch from, and make pull requests to, the
``main`` branch. The ``main`` branch is used only for releases. Pull requests
may be made from a fork, for those without repository write access.

Issues can be raised at

    https://github.com/poptus/IBCDFO/issues

Issues may include reporting bugs or suggested features.

By convention, user branch names should have a ``<type>/<name>`` format, where
example types are ``feature``, ``bugfix``, ``testing``, ``docs``, and
``experimental``.  Administrators may take a ``hotfix`` branch from the main,
which will be merged into ``main``.

When a branch closes a related issue, the pull request message should include
the phrase "Closes #N," where N is the issue number.

New features should be accompanied by at least one test case.

All pull requests to ``main`` must be reviewed by at least one administrator.
