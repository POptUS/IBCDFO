The tests in this folder were used to help verify the Python port of POUNDERS
against the MATALB code.  They generally need a reference `.mat` file to
function.

The code here
* might or might not work,
* is not maintained, and
* the `.mat` files are not included in this repository.

Given the above, these tests are **not** included in our test suite.  In
addition, they are not considered to be part of the package and, therefore, are
not included in distributions of the package.
