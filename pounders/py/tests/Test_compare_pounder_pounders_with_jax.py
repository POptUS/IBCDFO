"""
This tests pounder (no structure) against pounders with a novel hfun from
quantum. The objective is a function of a real vector gamma and a complex
vector output G_of_gamma. Given these, the objective is
imag(sum_{i=1}^m gamma_i*G_of_gamma**2), which is
sum_{i=1}^m imag(gamma_i*G_of_gamma**2), which is
sum_{i=1}^m gamma_i*imag(G_of_gamma**2), which is
sum_{i=1}^m 2 * gamma_i*G_of_gamma_r*G_of_gamma_i

This is the hfun. So given gamma, the Ffun computes G_of_gamma and returns its
real and imaginary parts.
