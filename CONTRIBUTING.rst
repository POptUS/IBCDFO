Contributing to IBCDFO
======================

Contributions of source code, documentations, and fixes are happily
accepted via GitHub pull request to

    https://github.com/poptus/IBCDFO/tree/develop

If you are planning a contribution, reporting bugs, or suggesting features,
we encourage you to discuss the concept by opening a github issue at

  https://github.com/poptus/IBCDFO/issues

or by emailing  ``poptus@mcs.anl.gov``
and interacting with us to ensure that your effort is well-directed.

Contribution Process
--------------------

Contributors should typically branch from, and
make pull requests to, the ``main`` branch. The ``main`` branch is used only
for releases. Pull requests may be made from a fork, for those without
repository write access.

Issues can be raised at

    https://github.com/poptus/IBCDFO/issues

Issues may include reporting bugs or suggested features.

By convention, user branch names should have a ``<type>/<name>`` format, where
example types are ``feature``, ``bugfix``, ``testing``, ``docs``, and
``experimental``.
Administrators may take a ``hotfix`` branch from the main, which will be
merged into ``main``.

When a branch closes a related issue, the pull request message should include
the phrase "Closes #N," where N is the issue number.

New features should be accompanied by at least one test case.

All pull requests to ``main`` must be reviewed by at least one administrator.
