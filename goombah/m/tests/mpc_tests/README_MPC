the following instructions will run the four numerical optimization methods on
a subset of problems, process the runs to determine if each point evaluated is
approximately stationary, and then produce numerous data profiles. 

a reviewer will need matlab and gams with the gdxmrw interface. see, 
https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/t_gdxmrw.html
or 
https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ferris/matlab/gdxmrw.pdf

1. open matlab and run call_many_manifold_sampling_methods_on_many_hfuns.m.
(note that there is caching of runs so that re-running
call_many_manifold_sampling_methods_on_many_hfuns.m doesn't re-do completed
runs.) if re-running is desired, remove the directory:
larmen_mpc/tests/benchmarking/benchmark_results

the runs in the paper were performed in parallel. the goombah method has
expensive subproblems and can be quite slow on some benchmark problems. to make
it easier for a reviewer to check the runs in serial, we have reduced the
number of experiments and the number of function evaluations allowed in each
experiment. (the number of function evaluations or the number of test problems can
be reduced by adjusting line 33 or line 59 of
call_many_manifold_sampling_methods_on_many_hfuns.m)

3. process results
after the runs are completed, run process_manifold_sampling_runs_alt.m to
compute the stationary measure around each point evaluated by each method.
adjust process_manifold_sampling_runs_alt.m (line 27) if the number of function
evaluations or problems was decreased. again, this processing may take some time
to perform in serial. the included numerical tests took approximately 20
minutes on a single computer.

4. produce data profiles  
run 
make_data_pros_f_and_subdiff.m
and
make_data_pros_f_and_subdiff_sub.m
to make data profiles from the (partial) runs. again, if the number of function
evaluations is increased, adjust line 3 of make_data_pros_f_and_subdiff.m and
make_data_pros_f_and_subdiff_sub.m. 

of course, the data profiles differ greatly from those in the paper because of
the decrease in the number of problems solved and the number of function
evaluations.
